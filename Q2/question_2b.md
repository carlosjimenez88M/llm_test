### Discuss how you would evaluate the impact of prompt optimization on the overall performance of the system. What experimental setups would you use to test and refine different prompts? How would you ensure that your prompt tweaks are improving performance? 

To evaluate the impact of prompt optimization on system performance, Iâ€™d take an iterative, data-driven approach:

1. **Design Controlled Experiments**: Create a baseline with the original prompt and compare it against optimized versions. Use a representative dataset and evaluate using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and semantic similarity.

2. **Automate and Refine**: Leverage tools like W&B Sweeps to systematically explore variations in prompt structure, content, and context. Use these experiments to identify the best-performing configurations.

3. **Focus on Incremental Gains**: Monitor improvements across tasks, ensuring that optimizations generalize beyond specific cases. For robust evaluation, include edge cases and noisy data.
