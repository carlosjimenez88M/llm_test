This repository is organized in such a way that you can access each of the proposed solutions by clicking on the questions. The approach I took for this development, considering the time allocated for responding, was as follows:

* **Focus on Machine Learning DevOps Engineering:** Ensuring modularized artifacts and systems.
* **For LLM developments or components:** The approach is directed towards AI programming, aiming for a balance between hardware and software requirements. Therefore, the inference presented in the exercises will be done using a Raspberry Pi, to bring everything into the context of CPU and system distribution.
* **Considering the test is focused on a startup development:** A success criterion will be the inclusion of PEP8 standards, which will be documented in the code.

Below are the questions:

### Part 1: LLMs and AI Agents Technical Assessment (30 Minutes)
1. LLM System Design and Evaluation (20 minutes)You are tasked with building an LLM-based agent for a customer-facing application in a startup. The goal is to optimize the agent for high-quality responses and continuously evaluate its performance. Make assumptions as needed. 
   * [Question 1a: Describe the architecture you would use to build this LLM agent, focusing on optimizing prompt engineering to achieve the best results. What strategies would you use to design effective prompts for different use cases (e.g., customer support, information retrieval)?](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/llm_test/blob/master/Q1/question_1a.md)
   * [Question 1b: Explain how you would set up an evaluation framework to assess the performance of the LLM. What metrics would you track, and how would you handle continuous evaluation (e.g., precision, recall, user satisfaction, response time)?](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/llm_test/blob/master/Q1/question_1a.md)[program](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/llm_test/tree/master/Q1/program_1b)
   * [Question 1c: Discuss how you would detect and manage data drift and model decay in the deployed system. What tools or techniques would you use to ensure the LLM remains effective over time? What metrics would you track?](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/llm_test/blob/master/Q1/question_1c.md) 

2. Advanced LLM Techniques: Prompt Optimization and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (10 minutes)You are working on a project that involves implementing RAG to improve the accuracy of an LLM-based system and fine-tuning the prompts for optimal performance.
   * [Question 2a: Describe your approach to optimizing prompts for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system. How would you maximize the retrieval of relevant information?](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/llm_test/blob/master/Q2/question_2a.md)
   * [Question 2b: Discuss how you would evaluate the impact of prompt optimization on the overall performance of the system. What experimental setups would you use to test and refine different prompts? How would you ensure that your prompt tweaks are improving performance?](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/llm_test/blob/master/Q2/question_2b.md)
